# PBPL 204: Regional Policy-Making Across Administrative Jurisdictions (Spring 2019)

Instructor: Sergio Rey  
Tuesdays: 5:40-8:30PM  
CHASS INTS-N Room 1006  
Office hours (Tues 4-5pm, Virtual Thurs 4-5pm)  



## Introduction
This course provides an introduction to the analytical tools used in regional
policy analysis as well as to the process of policy development, implementation,
and evaluation. It includes analysis of case studies of councils of government
and other regional bodies that have emerged or been created to provide regional
governance.


## Organization 
We meet one time a week and will organize the in-class meetings as follows. Each
session will begin exercises in collaborative knowledge building. These will
adopt active learning strategies involving collaborative discussion of a
regional concept, tool, or model. The collaboration will take the form of group
development of answers to several prompts/questions related to the topic at
hand. Readings related to the concept are listed by week and are to be completed
*prior* to the weekly meeting.

In the second part of the weekly meeting, we will put theory and concepts into
practice by implementing related models, tools, and frameworks using open source
computing resources. We will cover basic programming concepts useful for data wrangling, visualization, statistical analysis, and modeling.

The motivation for this organization is three-fold. First, computational
learning provides a deeper understanding of the theoretical concepts and
frameworks that are the focus of the readings and collaborative knowledge
development sessions. It is one thing to read about a regional economic
multiplier, but actually implementing the estimation of the particular
multiplier for a regional economy provides insights beyond what theory can
offer. Second, through these hands-on exercises, you will acquire skill-sets
that are highly sought in the field of public policy analysis. Third, no single
package currently exists that can handle the wide variety of data sets, and
formats, along with the diversity of models and analytical tools. This means
that the ability to do customized scripting is vital for success as a regional
policy analyst.

The key focus is on learning the main regional analytical tools used in the
study of regions. Programming and scripting are a means to this end. Although
prior programming experience would be helpful, it is not assumed, as all
computational concepts will be presented from first principles.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this course, students will:

* gain an understanding of the different types of analytical tools and models used in regional policy making and analysis;
* acquire working knowledge of the key sources of economic and demographic data for the study of regional economies in the United States;
* develop the ability to construct and apply a subset of the more widely used regional models to regions in California;
* learn principles of computational scripting and the importance of documentation and reproducibility in regional policy analysis workflows.

## Grading

Your course grade will be based on the following components

- Exercises (60 points)
- Quizzes  (30 points)
- Participation (10 points)

Four exercises will be introduced in class and are due on the dates listed in
the schedule. *No late assignments will be accepted*. Starting on 4/09, Quizzes
will be given at the beginning of each class meeting drawing from the material
in the assigned reading. Each quiz will be repeated following the class
discussion period. Your quiz grade for that week will be the average of these
two scores.


## Academic Integrity

The UCR student academic integrity policy lists violations in detail.
These violations fall into eight broad areas that include but are not
limited to: cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, facilitating academic
misconduct, unauthorized collaboration, interference or sabbotage,
non-compliance with research regulations and retaliation. For more
information about the UCR student academic integrity policy, please use
the following web link
<http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html>

## Disability accommodations

Qualified students with disabilities who will require disability
accommodations in this class are encouraged to make their requests to me
at the beginning of the quarter either during office hours or by
appointment. Note: Prior to receiving disability accommodations,
verification of eligibility from the [Student Disability Resource
Center](http://sdrc.ucr.edu/) is required. Disability information is
confidential.

## Code of Conduct 

As course instructor, I am dedicated to providing a harassment-free
learning experience for all students, regardless of gender, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
or choice of operating system. All course participants are expected to
show respect and courtesy to other students throughout the semester. As
a learning community we do not tolerate harassment of participants in
any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience
including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and
imagery are not appropriate in this course.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other students. Behave
professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or
exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the course.

Students violating these rules may be asked to leave the course, and
their violations will be reported to the UCR administration.

This code of conduct is an adaptation of the [SciPy 2017 Code of
Conduct](https://scipy2017.scipy.org/ehome/220975/493434/).
